# InstiNav

First, we started with getting familiar with basics of python. Begnning with variables, strings, arithmetics operators, llops, lists to functions, classes, dictionaries and what not. Then I followed the tutorial to two basic projects in python, first helped to edit excel spreadsheets and the latter was based on fundamental machine learning. In the project related to Machine learning, I was introduced to varios new tools and concepts like jupyter, panda, Decesion Tree, train_test_split, accuracy_score etc. 

Then, we started learning about Image segmentaion and some image segmentation technique. 

The mentors told us about the OpenCV library which we will be using for most of the image and video realted problems and projects. I started a tutorial to learn the usage of OpenCV.
